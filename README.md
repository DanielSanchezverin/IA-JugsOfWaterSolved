# IA-JarOfWaterSolved

Instructions: Develop a program that solves the problem of water jugs, indicating each step the current state, the applicable rules, the applied rule and the new state. The selection of the applied rule will be random.

Water Jugs: There are two jugs, one with a capacity of 4 gallon and the other with 3. Neither of them have measurement marks. We have a tap that allows you to fill the jugs with water. The solution is to get exactly 2 gallons of water in the 4 Gallon jug.

Possible actions.
These would be the actions that we could execute on the water jugs:
    Fill the 4 gallon jug
    Fill the 3 gallon jug
    Empty the 4 gallon jug
    Empty the 3 gallon jug
    Transfer from 4 gallon jug to 3 gallon jug
    Transfer from 3 gallon jug to 4 gallon jug

This code can be improved by adding 2 inputs and putting them in the constants that are in the conditions.
